# test-trading

My experineces with the alpaca API and paper (fake) trading


# Stuff I learned

To carry out tests, I learned about nohup. nohup will allow programs to run without
a command terminal

example usage: nohup command ">{optional file redirect}" &

It will run as a background process
Use kill -9 {process id} to end it
Use ps command to find the process id, the number is also given when you run nohup
